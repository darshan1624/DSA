Datastructures: They are are different ways of organising the data on your 
computer, that can be used effectively.
All applications deal with data. Before processing the data we have to 
organise the data in a certain way, that makes the process efficient.
Performance and efficiency of application depends on how the data is
structured, organised and grouped together. 

Algorithm: 
Set of rules for a computer to perform a task.

Types of Datastructures:
- Premitive 
	They are basic datatypes, cannot be broken in to smaller dtypes.
	Integer, Float, String, Boolean
- NonPremitive
	They are complex datastructures, can be broken into samller dtypes.
   - linear (list, tuple, array, linkedlist, stack, queue)
	Elements are arranged in sequential order.
   - non linear (set, dictionary, Tree, Graph)
	Elements are ordered in hierarical order to represent certain 
		relationship.

Types of Algorithms:
- Sorting (bubble sort, insertion sort)
- search (linear, binary search )
- Graph (depth, breadth, dijktras algorithm)
- Dynamic programming algorithms
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms
- Recursive


What is BigO ?
The metric used to measure the efficiency of the code is called BigO.
It is calculated by identifying the number of operations performed.

Notations: 
 bestcase Omega Ω
 averagecase thetha θ
 worstcase bigO O

Run time complxities: 
O(1): constant time compelxity
O(n): Linear time complexity (As the input grows, number of operations also
	grow.)
O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity
O(logn): logarithmic complexity.  it is very edficient than O(n^2) and O(n)

Space complexity:
It measure how the memory space consumed as he input size grows.
